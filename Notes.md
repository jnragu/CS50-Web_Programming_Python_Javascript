# HTML and CSS

## HTML

HTML — Hypertext Markup Language

Describes the structure of the webpage 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang='en'>
  <head>
    <title> Hello !</title>
  </head>
</html>
```

`<!DOCTYPE html>` 
	➜ DOCTYPE declaration
	➜ Way of telling the web browser that we are using HTML5

After, our HTML page is structured as a series of nested HTML elements
	➜ An HTML element describes something on the page

#### HTML tag —`<html>` 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>	<!-- Beginning of the HTML content -->
 	<!-- Content of the HTML page -->
</html> <!-- End of the HTML content -->
```

#### HTML attribute

An HTML attribute is some additional information that we give the HTML tag 

`<html lang = 'en'>` ➜ Tells the web browser that this page is written in English
